	<h2>How to Write a Blog Post - July 12 2013</h2>

	<p>For the past two weeks, I have wanted to write a blog post. I wanted to write a decent post from my point of view. I wanted to write something insightful that would encourage readers to share my post. I wanted to convey passion through my words and win readers&apos; hearts. I wanted to see some tears shed and music start. Well, how did I do it? Luckily for you, I wrote down my seven steps to save you time on your next blog post. </p>

	<p><b>1. Just do it!</b></p>

	<p>Hooray! I have blogged every day for two weeks! As you can tell this is my first post so clearly this step didn&apos;t work for me. Instead, I mulled over what to write about and how to write it for two weeks. I wanted my first post to be perfect, one that people read and say &quot;wow, what a great blog.&quot; These are the things I really did in the last two weeks: I watched the cursor blink on a white screen 26 times (yes I counted). I changed my website&apos;s background image five times. I brainstormed marketing ideas. I watched Jennifer Lawrence dance in Silver Linings Playbook. I went to a friend&apos;s bachelorette party. I ate a giant roast pig (true!). If it was easy, I wouldn&apos;t have had more steps for you.</p>
 
	<p><b>2. Read other blog posts</b></p>

	<p>Read Startup Institute&apos;s blog. Read your friends&apos; blogs. Read &quot;How to write a blog post&quot; posts. Read blogs from your favorite celebrities. Read about getting your pants pulled off by screaming girls. Go back to reading your friends&apos; blogs. See that they had written more blog posts. Feel inadequate. Write down each and every idea that may come to you. Pretend that you wrote down lots of ideas. Realize you only need one idea. </p>

	<p><b>3. Talk to others </b></p>

	<p>Luckily, I was able to find some nice people who were willing to talk to me and spare me from my doomed post, but you can just substitute my talking for any action you want. Step three is all about learning and finding your inner voice. It&apos;s all about the act of replacing more urgent actions with tasks less urgent, or doing something from which one derives enjoyment, and thus putting off impending tasks to a later time.  </p>

	<p>Things I learned while talking to others: what they wrote about, what they like to read, what they think you&apos;re good at, what they think the difference between men and women are. </p>

	<p><b>4. Find an inspiration</b></p>

	<p>This is the crucial step. The step when I went from no blog post to something of a blog post. A pivotal act or event will help you unleash your creativity. For me, it was a person. After the third week of Startup Institute, I thought that I was more likely to slay a dragon than have a blog post up by the following week. However, hearing again how important of a blog can be from Lucy Orloski, a talented marketing director, made me realize that a picture of a giant roast pig isn&apos;t going to cut it as relevant content. Lucy gave the technical marketing track at Startup Institute inspiring advice along with very helpful blogging tips. She encouraged me to &quot;Just do it!&quot; </p>

	
	<p><b>5. Start writing! </b></p>

	<p> I think you can handle this one. </p>	

	<p><b>6. Edit </b></p>

	<p>This is the fun step. Okay, think of it like the last step in getting frozen yogurt at one of those &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; counters. I already walked around the yogurt dispensers and realized I can&apos;t decide on one flavor, so I filled up on every available flavor. I wiped up most of the froyo I accidentally spilled around the dispenser and on the floor (none, on a good day). The last step is adding a topping or two! You get to spruce up the blog post and add a picture or two if you&apos;d like. That&apos;s it!  </p>
	
	<p><b>7. Post it! Congratulations!</b></p>
